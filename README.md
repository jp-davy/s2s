# Send To Santa - Laravel App

This app was a code sample I provided, built around a set of requirements.

The basic app is titled Send To Santa, allowing users to post a message to Santa. The app...

- Displays all messages (including name, email, and message), ordered by most recent
- Displays 10 messages per page, with more page links at the bottom
- Has a form to post a message, requiring Name, Email, and Message
- Name, Email, and Message are required fields, validated on both the front end and back end
- A user can register for a login
- Upon registration, any existing messages associated with that email address will belong to that login
- A user with a login can delete their own messages (but not others)
- Messages and users are stored in a MySQL database
- Backend is built with Laravel PHP
- Frontend is basic bootstrap css/jquery/VueJS
